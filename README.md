### Hello world
```python
print("Hello, world.")
```

<a name = "02"></a>
### Hello, name
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, %s" % name)
```

<a name = "03"></a>
### Print empty tic-tac-toe board
```python
# Print an empty board

print("  |  |  ")
print("  |  |  ")
print("  |  |  ")
```

<a name = "04"></a>
### Add X and O to board
```python
# Create an array of 9 spaces to represent our board
board = [' ']*9
print(board)

# Show change of value
board[0] = 'X'

print("\nLet's play tic tac toe!\n")
print(" %s | %s | %s "  % (board[0],board[1],board[2]))
print(" %s | %s | %s "   % (board[3],board[4],board[5]))
print(" %s | %s | %s \n" % (board[6],board[7],board[8]))
```

<a name = "05"></a>
### Let user add an X to the board
```python
# Initialize board array
board = [' ']*9

boardPosition = input('Give me a number from 0-8: ')
boardPosition = int(boardPosition)

board[boardPosition] = 'X'

print("\nLet's play tic tac toe!\n")
print(" %s | %s | %s "   % (board[0],board[1],board[2]))
print(" %s | %s | %s "   % (board[3],board[4],board[5]))
print(" %s | %s | %s \n" % (board[6],board[7],board[8]))
```

<a name = "06"></a>
### Check for winner
```python
# Pick some configuration for board
board = ['X', 'X', 'X',
         'O', 'O', ' ',
         ' ', ' ', ' ' ]

# Print the board
print("\nLet's play tic tac toe!\n")
print(" %s | %s | %s "  % (board[0],board[1],board[2]))
print(" %s | %s | %s "   % (board[3],board[4],board[5]))
print(" %s | %s | %s \n" % (board[6],board[7],board[8]))

# Check if there is a winner
    # You're a winner if you have three spots occupied horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

# Horizontally
if (board[0] == board[1] == board[2] and board[0]!= ' ') or (board[3] == board[4] == board[5] and board[3]!=' ') or (board[6] == board[7] == board[8] and board[0]!=' '):
    print('There is a winner')
```

<a name = "07"></a>
### Intro to `if` statements
Example together
```python
guess = input("Give me a number between 1 and 5: ")
guess = int(guess)

myNumber = 3

if guess == myNumber:
    print("Yay")
else:
    print("You suck.")
```

### A faster way to check for winner
```python
# Pick some configuration for board
board = ['X', 'X', 'X',
         'O', 'O', ' ',
         ' ', ' ', ' ' ]

# Print the board
print("\nLet's play tic tac toe!\n")
print(" %s | %s | %s "  % (board[0],board[1],board[2]))
print(" %s | %s | %s "   % (board[3],board[4],board[5]))
print(" %s | %s | %s \n" % (board[6],board[7],board[8]))

# Check if there is a winner
    # You're a winner if you have three spots occupied horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

# Horizontally
for i in range(0,7,3):
    if board[i] == board[i+1] == board[i+2] and board[i] != ' ':
        print("There is a winner")
```

<a name = "09"></a>
### Intro to `for` loops
```python
for i in range(0,100):
    print('Raffi, %i' % i)
```

<a name = "10"></a>
### Checking for diaganol lines
```python
# Pick some configuration for board
board = ['X', 'X', 'X',
         'O', 'O', 'O',
         ' ', ' ', ' ' ]

# Print the board
print("\nLet's play tic tac toe!\n")
print(" %s | %s | %s "  % (board[0],board[1],board[2]))
print(" %s | %s | %s "   % (board[3],board[4],board[5]))
print(" %s | %s | %s \n" % (board[6],board[7],board[8]))

# Check if there is a winner
    # You're a winner if you have three spots occupied horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

# Horizontally
for i in range(0,7,3):
    if board[i] == board[i+1] == board[i+2] and board[i] != ' ':
        print("There is a winner")

# Vertically
for i in range(0,3,1):
    if board[i] == board[i+3] == board[i+6] and board[i] != ' ':
        print("There is a winner")

# Diagonally
if board[0] == board[4] == board[8] and board[0] != ' ':
    print("There is a winner")

if board[2] == board[4] == board[6] and board[2] != ' ':
    print("There is a winner")
```

### Putting everything into functions
```python

# Pick some configuration for board
board = ['X', 'X', 'X',
         'O', 'O', 'O',
         ' ', ' ', ' ' ]

# Print the board
def print_board(board):
    print("\nLet's play tic tac toe!\n")
    print(" %s | %s | %s "   % (board[0],board[1],board[2]))
    print(" %s | %s | %s "   % (board[3],board[4],board[5]))
    print(" %s | %s | %s \n" % (board[6],board[7],board[8]))

# Check if there is a winner
    # You're a winner if you have three spots occupied horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

# Horizontally
def checkHorizontal(board):
    for i in range(0,7,3):
        if board[i] == board[i+1] == board[i+2] and board[i] != ' ':
            return True

# Vertically
def checkVertical(board):
    for i in range(0,3,1):
        if board[i] == board[i+3] == board[i+6] and board[i] != ' ':
            return True

# Diagonally
def checkDiaganol(board):
    if board[0] == board[4] == board[8] and board[0] != ' ' or (board[2] == board[4] == board[6] and board[2] != ' '):
        return True

# Check if there is a winner using the functions from above
def isWinner(board):
    if checkHorizontal(board) or checkVertical(board) or checkDiaganol(board):
        return True

# Let's try it
if isWinner(board):
    print('There is a winner!')

while True:	
    # Get user input
    x = input("Give me a number from 1-9: ")
    x = int(x)

    # Put X into board
    board[x-1] = 'X'
    print_board(board)

    if isWinner(board):

print_board(board)

while True:
    # Get user input
    x = input("Give me a number from 1-9: ")

    print_board(board)
    
    if isWinner(board):
        print('You win!')
	break
    
    # Check for tie
    elif ' ' not in board:
        print('Tie game.')
        break
    
    # Switch players
    else:
	if player == 'X':

        else:
